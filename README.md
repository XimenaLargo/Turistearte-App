## How to execute? 🚀
Before you begin you must have AWS credentials and an RDS database deployed and an email configured with the Gmail SMTP server for this project.

1. Clone this repository
```
https://github.com/XimenaLargo96/Turistearte-App.git
```
2. Replace in the application.properties file the AWS credentials and the email and password that you want to use.
   
3. (optional) If you have a GitLab account and want to perform automatic deployment, set the environment variables to replace the credentials. The .gitlab-ci.yml file contains the script for automatic deployment, keeping in mind that you must have an EC2 machine on AWS running the Linux operating system.
